Global warming, a term often used interchangeably with climate change, refers to the long-term rise in the Earth's average temperature, primarily caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels, leading to increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major contributor, but other gases like methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor also play a role. The Earth naturally has a "greenhouse effect" where certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat, keeping the planet warm enough to support life. However, human activities have increased the concentration of these gases, intensifying the greenhouse effect and leading to global warming.
